Thoughts on changes needed for the Open Referral Standard in Spain
=================================================================
- A 'super/supra' organization, one that can encompass other organizations, but without necessarily having locations and services of its own. This would be needed to nest properly the Government services, so that the local government is an organization, which has sub-organizations such as an 'Elderly' department or 'Family and Children' department. It doesn't make sense that an admin of 'Elderly' would have write access to 'Children', but it also does not make sense to call these completely separate organizations, as I have had to do now.

- The implementation of Opening Hours would have to be modified for Spain. It is quite common to have a 'split' openings schedule, being open in the morning and in the afternoon (but not midday), such as open 9-14 and 17-20 (e.g.). This (might?) be possible from the API, but it is not possible to input from the admin interface.
